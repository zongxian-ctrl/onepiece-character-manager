# One Piece Character Manager — Design

Date: 2026-07-07

## Overview

A CRUD web application for managing One Piece characters, with a persistent
backend. Users can create, read, update, and delete characters, search/filter
them, and see character avatars.

## Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (REST API)
- **Frontend:** React + Vite
- **Persistence:** SQLite via `better-sqlite3` (synchronous API, single-file
  database, native `:memory:` support for tests)

The frontend talks to the backend over a REST API rooted at `/api/characters`.
In development, the Vite dev server proxies `/api` to Express to avoid CORS.

`db.js` exports a **factory** (e.g. `createDb(path)`) rather than a single
fixed connection, so the app opens `characters.db` while tests inject
`:memory:`. Schema init and seeding run against whichever connection is passed.

## Data Model

Table `characters`:

| column      | type                     | notes                       |
|-------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| id          | INTEGER PK autoincrement |                             |
| name        | TEXT NOT NULL            | required                    |
| epithet     | TEXT                     | e.g. "Straw Hat"            |
| crew        | TEXT                     | affiliation                 |
| devil_fruit | TEXT                     | nullable                    |
| bounty      | INTEGER                  | in berries; 64-bit, holds billions |
| role        | TEXT                     | e.g. Captain, Navigator     |
| image_url   | TEXT                     | shown as avatar             |
| description | TEXT                     | free text                   |
| created_at  | TEXT                     | ISO timestamp               |

## API

| Method | Route                      | Purpose                          |
|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/characters?search=`  | list, optional name/crew filter  |
| GET    | `/api/characters/:id`      | fetch one                        |
| POST   | `/api/characters`          | create (validated)               |
| PUT    | `/api/characters/:id`      | update (validated)               |
| DELETE | `/api/characters/:id`      | delete                           |

Backend validation: `name` required (non-empty); `bounty`, if present, must be
a non-negative integer (bounties reach the billions — parsed as a JS number,
which is safe well beyond that). Validation failures return `400` with a JSON
error message. Missing resources return `404`.

`PUT` is a **full replace**: the client sends all editable fields and the row
is overwritten. This matches the reused create/edit form, which always submits
the complete field set.

## Frontend Flow

Single-page UI: a search bar above a responsive grid of character cards. Each
card shows avatar, name, epithet, and bounty, with Edit and Delete actions. An
"Add Character" button opens a form. The same form component handles both
create and edit. Client-side validation mirrors the backend rules. Application
state lives in `App.jsx`; the character list is re-fetched after each mutation.

The UI shows a loading state while fetching and surfaces API failures inline
(an error message) rather than failing silently. Delete prompts for
confirmation before removing a character.

## Extras

- **Seed data:** Straw Hat crew members inserted on first run if the table is
  empty.
- **Search/filter:** `?search=` matches name or crew via SQL `LIKE`.
- **Validation:** enforced on both client and server.
- **Images:** `image_url` rendered as an avatar, with a placeholder fallback
  when empty or on load error.

## Testing

- **Backend:** API route tests (supertest) run against an in-memory SQLite
  database, covering CRUD success paths and validation/not-found errors.
- **Frontend:** kept simple; manual verification via the running app.

## Out of Scope (YAGNI)

- Authentication / user accounts
- Pagination (dataset is small)
- Image file uploads (URLs only)
- Deployment configuration
